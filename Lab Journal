  Raspberry pi was set up. Started to look at how the camera functioned and which packages were needed.

  Experiment 001 was started using the code 'Area_det_single'.
    This was done with ABS in Acetone and water mix.
    To get the area detection accurate, The day was spent finetuning the parameters of the canny edge code manually untill a consistent and correct area was read.
    Experiment was made to run overnight.

Date 8/04/25
  error in the code was found. Since when a new reading was started, it deleted the old measurments. Due to this the taken pictures of the ABS plastic were lost
  A mistake was also made that the petri dish was not covered. So the acetone was evapurated out during the night and and the lightpad was melted because of that. Still a small decrease in area was noted. However decrease was 
  so small that it can't be said if that is because of the acetone or just inaccuracies of the camera, since the acetone was evapurated.

  Started experiment 002:
    First experiment was to look at multiple things. Firstly see if the Region Of Interest code worked for multiple plastics and to see if it will be ran trough the whole day.
    the plastic used was PLC. It was places in 2 small petri dishes. One filled with demi water and the other filled with demi water and HCl. To look if their is a difference in dissolving between normal and acidic envoriments.
    Every 10 second the area was calculated by the code and a picture was taken.

Date 9/04/25
  Ended experiment 002:
    Area did not decerease. Decided to leave the plastic in the solution for a few more days.
  Some pictures were deleted due to space issues
  Changed the code a bit to now make a picture of the setup every 60 min. picture of the roi every 30 min and calculate the area every 10 seconds and the picture taken were now halved in resolution
  This was done so that the pictures would not fill up the memory. 

  Started exp 002-2: same as 002 with different time intervals for measurments.

Date 10/04/25
  The experiment was kept running

  The experiment was kept running

Date 14/04/25
  The experiment was kept running due to strikes.

Date: 15/04/25
  Ended Experiment 002-2.
  Data was inconclusive. The area's did not seem to decrease to decrease
  The results were discussed with Vittorio and it was decided to change the plastic to PLA and to dissolve it in Ethyl Acetate and Ethanol. 
  For this the code was changed where there were 6 ROI in it. With the ratios being 1(100/0), 2(80/20), 3(60/40), 4(40/60), 5(20/80), 6(0/100)
  Then the plastics squares were printed out using the 3d printer with the dimentions; 20:20:1 mm
  Then the setup was finalised for the experiment to start the next day
  Checked if the area of the plastic would still be acurae if the plastic was broken in multiple pieces. The area stayed roughly the same. Except an increase of arount ~0.1-0.2 cm^2.

Date 16/04/25
  On this day the camera of the raspberry pi was broken
  It took some time to figure out what part was wrong. Eventually it was concluded that the cable that connects the camera to the pi was not functioning
  To repair this, a spare cable from my Phd was used.
  Then it seemed that there were not enough space and petri dishes for all 6 ROI to run. So it was decided to only use 5. Then the each ROI had the following ratio's of Ethyl Acetaat and Ethanol:
  1(100/0), 2(75/25), 3(50/50), 4(25/75), 5(0/100)
  Experiment 003 was started. 

Date 17\04\25
  Experiment 003 was looked at
    in the 100% Ethyl Acetaat seemed to react the most with it. A area increase was noted by the program and by eye. Also small pieces of plastic could be noticed in the solution. However during the night part of the ethyl Acetaat was evapurated out of 
    the petri dish and part of it was probably taken in by the plastic acting as a sponge. Hence, the area increase. 
    Going to lower ratio's ov the Ethyl Acetaat the reaction observed gets less. With the 100% ethanol, it seems to not have increased or decreased any noteworthy amount.
    During the night the camera seemed to have moved. Due to this quiete alot of the measurments were made invalid. However it is not known how it moved. Either someone bumped into it the following moring or the tape holding the camera in place, had 
    gotten loose and made the camera sift to the left.

  The experiment 003B was started. This is the same as 003 with 2 changes: The canny edge parameters were changed accordingly to see less noise/unwanted edges and the solvents for the plastics were refillt

    For the next experiment smaller plastic pieces would likely be better with a better fitting lid on the petri dishes. So the evapuration can be lessened and the plastic will take up less of the solvent/dissolve faster in the solvent. 

  Data analysis of exp 002 was started using python.

  Experiment 003 was ended
    Points of interest
      -The 100% ethyl acetate has shown changes in area and the 100% alcohol hasn't
      -The lowever percentages of ethyl acetate have less area changes
      -Some of the plastic pieces have seemed to move place, thus the area detection has stopped working
      -The plastic while dissolving, seems to dissolve first at his thickness and only then on his sides. So it get less thick in the middle, making the sides fold in and making it seem as the area is smaller than in acuallity on the camera
      -Due to camera distortion effect, the plastic pieces in the middle seem to be smaller than the plastic pieces in the middle.

  Needed Improvements:
      -Getting rid of the distortian effect using opencv camera calibration: Code Change --> Multiple_Area_improved
      -Making the ROI circular and the same size as the petri dishes as to fix the problem of the plastic squares moving out of the ROI area --> Multiple_Area_improved
      -Making the plastic pieces thinner, from 1mm --> 0.3mm
      -Having better fitting lids on the petri dishes to prevent evapuration

  Print out 11 pieces of plastic of the dimentions 20mm:20mm:0.3mm
