  Experiment 001 was started using the code 'Area_det_single'.
    This was done with ABS in Acetone and water mix.
    To get the area detection accurate, The day was spent finetuning the parameters of the canny edge code manually untill a consistent and correct area was read.
    Experiment was made to run overnight.

Date 8/04/25
  error in the code was found. Since when a new reading was started, it deleted the old measurments. Due to this the taken pictures of the ABS plastic were lost
  A mistake was also made that the petri dish was not covered. So the acetone was evapurated out during the night and and the lightpad was melted because of that. Still a small decrease in area was noted. However decrease was 
  so small that it can't be said if that is because of the acetone or just inaccuracies of the camera, since the acetone was evapurated.

  Started experiment 002:
    First experiment was to look at multiple things. Firstly see if the Region Of Interest code worked for multiple plastics and to see if it will be ran trough the whole day.
    the plastic used was PLC. It was places in 2 small petri dishes. One filled with demi water and the other filled with demi water and HCl. To look if their is a difference in dissolving between normal and acidic envoriments.
    Every 10 second the area was calculated by the code and a picture was taken.

Date 9/04/25
  Ended experiment 002:
    Area did not decerease. Decided to leave the plastic in the solution for a few more days.
  Some pictures were deleted due to space issues
  Changed the code a bit to now make a picture of the setup every 60 min. picture of the roi every 30 min and calculate the area every 10 seconds and the picture taken were now halved in resolution
  This was done so that the pictures would not fill up the memory. 

  Started exp 002-2: same as 002 with different time intervals for measurments.

Date 10/04/25
  The experiment was kept running

Date 14/04/25
  The experiment was kept running due to strikes.

Date: 15/04/25
  Ended Experiment 002-2.
  Data was inconclusive. The area's did not seem to decrease to decrease
  The results were discussed with Vittorio and it was decided to change the plastic to PLA and to dissolve it in Ethyl Acetate and Ethanol. 
  For this the code was changed where there were 6 ROI in it. With the ratios being 1(100/0), 2(80/20), 3(60/40), 4(40/60), 5(20/80), 6(0/100)
  Then the plastics squares were printed out using the 3d printer with the dimentions; 20:20:1 mm
  Then the setup was finalised for the experiment to start the next day
  Checked if the area of the plastic would still be acurae if the plastic was broken in multiple pieces. The area stayed roughly the same. Except an increase of arount ~0.1-0.2 cm^2.

Date 16/04/25
  On this day the camera of the raspberry pi was broken
  It took some time to figure out what part was wrong. Eventually it was concluded that the cable that connects the camera to the pi was not functioning
  To repair this, a spare cable from my Phd was used.
  Then it seemed that there were not enough space and petri dishes for all 6 ROI to run. So it was decided to only use 5. Then the each ROI had the following ratio's of Ethyl Acetaat and Ethanol:
  1(100/0), 2(75/25), 3(50/50), 4(25/75), 5(0/100)
  Experiment 003 was started. 

Date 17\04\25
  Experiment 003 was looked at
    in the 100% Ethyl Acetaat seemed to react the most with it. A area increase was noted by the program and by eye. Also small pieces of plastic could be noticed in the solution. However during the night part of the ethyl Acetaat was evapurated out of 
    the petri dish and part of it was probably taken in by the plastic acting as a sponge. Hence, the area increase. 
    Going to lower ratio's ov the Ethyl Acetaat the reaction observed gets less. With the 100% ethanol, it seems to not have increased or decreased any noteworthy amount.
    During the night the camera seemed to have moved. Due to this quiete alot of the measurments were made invalid. However it is not known how it moved. Either someone bumped into it the following moring or the tape holding the camera in place, had 
    gotten loose and made the camera sift to the left.

  The experiment 003B was started. This is the same as 003 with 2 changes: The canny edge parameters were changed accordingly to see less noise/unwanted edges and the solvents for the plastics were refillt

    For the next experiment smaller plastic pieces would likely be better with a better fitting lid on the petri dishes. So the evapuration can be lessened and the plastic will take up less of the solvent/dissolve faster in the solvent. 

  Data analysis of exp 002 was started using python.

  Experiment 003 was ended
    Points of interest
      -The 100% ethyl acetate has shown changes in area and the 100% alcohol hasn't
      -The lowever percentages of ethyl acetate have less area changes
      -Some of the plastic pieces have seemed to move place, thus the area detection has stopped working
      -The plastic while dissolving, seems to dissolve first at his thickness and only then on his sides. So it get less thick in the middle, making the sides fold in and making it seem as the area is smaller than in acuallity on the camera
      -Due to camera distortion effect, the plastic pieces in the middle seem to be smaller than the plastic pieces in the middle.

  Needed Improvements:
      -Getting rid of the distortian effect using opencv camera calibration: Code Change --> Multiple_Area_improved
      -Making the ROI circular and the same size as the petri dishes as to fix the problem of the plastic squares moving out of the ROI area --> Multiple_Area_improved
      -Making the plastic pieces thinner, from 1mm --> 0.3mm
      -Having better fitting lids on the petri dishes to prevent evapuration
      -Try out different shapes of plastic   
  Print out different shapes of plastic

Date 23/04/25
  Looked further into camera calibration - still no succes.

 Start Exp 004
    -Different shapes of plastic in 100% ethyl acetate printed out, with Z = 0.5 mm
        1. Shape = 'Square' Width: X, Height: Y, Width Z,  Weight w
        2. Shape = 'circle' radius r,  Width Z,  Weight w
        3. Shape = 'cross', Width: X, Height: Y, Width Z,  Weight w
        4. Shape = 'ovale', Width: X, Height: Y, Width Z,  Weight w
        5. Shape = '#', Width: X, Height: Y, Width Z,  Weight w
  Width of 0.05 is too thin for the 3d printer. A larger width is necesarry, otherwise the palstic will have small howlse in its area

  The calibration code was made working. However the incorperation of the code into the area detection code has not been able to succeed.

Date 24/04/25
  -The incorperation of the camera calibration does not seem to work. Today was researched how to get it to work, however I could not find out how to incorperate this.

date 25/04/25
  -Decided to use the uncallibrated camera on different shapes. The shapes are dissolved in ethyl acetate. The dimension of the shapes are given below with their areas. However the areas found with the code and area reduction
    will not be accurate. Since the camera is not calibrated. So the results of this experiment won't be important. We shall take more of a look at how the plastic dissolves and if it can be left alone for over the weekend.

        1. Shape = 'Square' Width: 20mm, Height: 20mm, Width 0.6mm, Area: 400mm, Weight 0.31g,
        2. Shape = 'circle' Diameter 21mm,  Width 0.6mm , Area: 365,   Weight 0.22g,
        3. Shape = 'cross', Width (per staff): 5.10, Height(per staff): 30, Width 0.6, area: 106  Weight 0.35g 
        4. Shape = 'Square with Whole', Width: 20, Height: 20, Width 0.6, diameter_in: 9.74, Area:325.34, Weight 0.25g
        5. shape = 'donut, diameter_o: 21mm, diameter_i = 11.3 , area:  261, weigh 0.16g
        3. Shape = '#', Width (per staff): 5.10, Height(per staff): 30, Width 0.6, area: 508  Weight 0.47g 

    

Date 28/04/25
  Data analisis on exp 001 to 003 was completed: Data from 001 and 002 mostly seem like noise/camera mis readings. 003 had showed some increase in area size and then a decrease at the beginning. Which seems to agree with the fact that the plastic is dissolving

  Weekly meeting with Vittorio and Xiangyu
    Decided that the area calculation with the code was not reliable and good enough
      --> Will take a look in measuring the light intensity, Since then we plastic is dissolving a dark 'cloud' of plastic pieces form around the plastic, this interferce with the edge detection
          out thought is to use this as a form of measurment. To measure the pixel intensity within the ROI. Then correlate this pixel intensity back to that the plastic is dissoling and may even back to the thickness of the plastic.
          Finally it is a thought of combining both the edge detection and the light intensity measurments, to get a better understanding of how th eplastic is dissolving.

  I also decided that it is not necessarry at this moment to do multiple ROI measurment at the same time. Since the camera does not seem to handle that well, as the calibration code does not seem to work as expected. For this reason it was decided to 
  only have, maybe 2 ROI's to put the focus more on the individual pieces. Then later in the project to take a look at how it could be expended to work wilt multiple plastic pieces at the same time. A way could be to use more than one pi camera, or to make the calibration code
  fully working

  Research was done to look further into this plan and a start was made to to get the code for pixel intensity working.

Date 29/04/25
  Today was only coding. This was performed from with the program called pi-connect

  Firstly co-pilot student was installed on the computer. This helps with asking AI for help within the IDE. Then another look was taken at the camera calibration incorperation. However it still could not be fixed. (A check was performed to see if some of the files it tried to acces were empty and
  that could be why it didn't function. This was not the case)

  The rest of the day pixel_better was tried to be coded. This took far longer than was anticipated. The reason for this was a glitch with the interaction of the ROI and canny edge system, since the edges of the ROI were also seen as edges in the canny edge algorithm. The reason for this was
  that the maximum area was put too high, lowering this seemed to fix the issue. However this is not a full fix, but more of a bandage. Since I only made it so, that the code does not take edges of too large objects in fame.

  Further more a new heatmap was added to see the visualisation of the the pixel intensities.

  another csv file was made for the readings of the pixel intensities withing the ROI: Avg pixel intensity, max PI, Min Pi

  A new setup was thought of to make most of this function: using an beaker, a round piece of plastic will be hold in place. This be done with a rope or sticks, keeping the place of plastic in place within the beaker. Then using a stirbar to keep the mixture mixed, to have the colour of the mixture 
  as even as possible.

  Exp005:
    Exp 004 was continued with the new code. Only the circle ROI is being looked at this time. This is done, because it was deemed to be the most accurate shape to observe. 


Date 30/04/25
 Exp 004 was analyzed
    - cross:       w=0.41g,  d= 0,1g
    - donut:       w=0.22g,  d= 0.06g
    - #:           w=0.36g,  d=0.11g
    - square_hole: w=0.29g,  d=0.04g
    - square:      w=0.36g,  d=0.05
    - circle:      w=0.26,   d=0.04

  The result seem to indicate that the plastics have increases in weight, while the readings seem to indicate that the plastics are degrading and dissolving. More tests will be done to see if these readings are accurate. However, i expect
  that the weight were initially misread.

  Exp 005 was stopped:
    result do not seem to have a change in pixel intensity. Tests are going to performed today to see if the pixel intensity function performs as it would be expected. This will be done by changing the light level and adding dark objectrs within the ROI
    and looking if the pixel intensity lowers as it would be expected.
